# Pre-work - *Swiftip*

**Swiftip** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Santos Solorzano**

Time spent: **30+** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:
* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [x] Table view to store and display temporary bill history including dates and totals
* [x] Add total to bill history and hide keypad by pressing a button
* [x] Ability to delete bill history items by swiping to left

## Notes

Some of the challenges I encountered while building the app involved pairing up the right version of Xcode with the right version of my iOS device; I was attempting to test and develop this app on my iPhone 6, but decided to revert back to my iPhone 5 and use the iPhone 5S Simulator to run my app. Another challenge I encountered that I will work on overcoming was persistence because the data being displayed in my table-view was not being stored, and therefore the user did not have the bill history that I initially was planning for.
